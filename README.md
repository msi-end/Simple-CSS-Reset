# Simple-CSS-Reset

A CSS Reset file circumvents inconsistencies across different browsers when developing websites. All browsers have default rules with properties and values applied to all pages before loading files. Due to the cascading nature of CSS, any styles the browser uses will remain unless explicitly overridden. A CSS Reset file targets all rules that the different browsers apply defaults to and resets them to their minimum possible value.
